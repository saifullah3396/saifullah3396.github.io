# Hi, I'm Saifullah ðŸ‘‹

I grew up playing computer games and was therefore always quite fluent with computers, 
but I formally started programming in 2012 at my university with a C/C++ course where I made a 
GUI-based Reversi game. Soon after, I got involved in aerial robotics as an intern 
(mostly MATLAB for numerical computations), and 
later joined the Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) Lab at my university for my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s theses. 
There I worked extensively in C++/Python on humanoid robotics, with tasks ranging from motion control, computer vision, networking, 
SLAM, and behavioral planning, and I also led my universityâ€™s RoboCup team.


## Research
At the RISE Lab, I worked on motion control, kinematics, computer vision, SLAM, and behavior planning...

## Now

As a PhD student in Germany, I focus on **deep learning, document analysis, explainable AI, and privacy-preserving ML**.

I grew up playing computer games and was therefore always quite fluent with computers, but I formally started programming in 2012 at my university with a C/C++ course where I made a GUI-based Reversi game. Soon after, I got involved in aerial robotics as an intern (mostly MATLAB for numerical computations), and later joined the Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) Lab at my university for my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s theses. There I worked extensively in C++/Python on humanoid robotics, with tasks ranging from motion control, computer vision, networking, SLAM, and behavioral planning, and I also led my universityâ€™s RoboCup team.

Since then, I have been programming for over a decade, with experience spanning robotics, UAV systems, computer vision, and deep learning. As a Research Associate at NCAI Pakistan, I led projects integrating ROS, PX4, and reinforcement learning for UAVs, implemented GPU-accelerated obstacle avoidance algorithms, and deployed real-time computer vision systems with NVIDIA DeepStream. I also worked quite extensively with simulators such as Gazebo, VREP, AirSym, etc. In parallel, I also worked at Ingenio on Edge AI for deployment of DL models Nvidia Jetson Nanos.

Later in my PhD, my focus shifted towards deep learning, where I have built end-to-end pipelines for multimodal document analysis, explainable AI, and privacy-preserving machine learning, with extensive use of PyTorch. In this time I have explored a wide variety of deep learning areas, and my expertise include training/eval of end-to-end multi-modal transformers, diffusion models for generative AI, active learning, model robustness, explainable and responsible AI, and differential privacy and distributed training in deep learning. In addition, I have extensive experience with MLOps and ML data storage/manipulation.

Altogether, I have been programming for more than 12 years, and programming has been a central tool for me, whether it was for low-level systems integration, high-performance algorithms, modern deep learning research or DevOps.
