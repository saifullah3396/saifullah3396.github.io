              I&apos;ve loved computers and video games for as long as I can
              remember, so programming came naturally. I started coding in 2012
              with a C/C++ course at university, building a Reversi game
              project, and soon got into robotics, first aerial robotics, then
              humanoid robotics for my Bachelor&apos;s and Master&apos;s theses.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time working on robotics, I have worked on several
              areas; motion planning and control, robot kinematics and dynamics,
              computer vision, SLAM, and behavior planning. I also led my
              university&apos;s RoboCup team for Standard Platform League,
              coding autonomous humanoid robots to play football.
            </p>
            <p>
              Afterwards, I joined the National Center of Artificial
              Intelligence (NCAI), Pakistan, leading projects in UAVs, robotics,
              and deep learning. During this time, I led projects integrating
              ROS, PX4, and reinforcement learning for UAVs, implemented
              GPU-accelerated obstacle avoidance algorithms, and deployed
              real-time computer vision systems with NVIDIA DeepStream. I also
              worked quite extensively with simulators such as Gazebo, VREP,
              AirSim, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, as a PhD researcher, I focus on explainable AI, private ML,
              and robust deep learning for document analysis, with extensive use
              of PyTorch. During this time time I have explored a wide variety
              of deep learning areas, and my areas of expertise include
              multi-modal document analysis, Explainable AI, GenAI, Diffusion
              Models, Differential Privacy and Distributed Training, Active
              Learning, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been coding for more than 10 years, however, there is still
              so much to learn and explore. I keep myself updated with the
              latest research and technologies, and I love contributing to
              open-source projects. When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy video
              games and anime!
